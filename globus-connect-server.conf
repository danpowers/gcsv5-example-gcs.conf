[GridFTP]
;This section configures a GridFTP server. It can be processed on the
;GridFTP server host to generate a GridFTP configuration file, and on
;that or any other host to add a GridFTP server to an endpoint
;
;
;        The service name of the GridFTP server. If not set,
;        then no GridFTP  service will be configured. The form of the name
;        is host[:port]. If port is not specified, then the default GridFTP
;        port 2811 is used.
;
;        If the value is set, then the service will be configured on the
;        local machine if one of the following conditions are met:
;
;        - The value of ServerName matches the current machine's public
;          hostname.
;        - The value of ServerName does not match the current machine's public
;          hostname, but the ServerHost matches the current machine's
;          hostname.
;
;        The special value %(HOSTNAME)s will substitute the machine's public
;        hostname. This is the default value.
;        
ServerName = ourserver.ourschool.edu
;
;        The name of the machine hosting the GridFTP Service. This
;        is used as described in the ServerName description.
;        The special value %(HOSTNAME)s will substitute the machine's public
;        hostname. By default this is unset.
;        
ServerHost = %(HOSTNAME)s
;
;        Port range to use for incoming connections.  The format is
;        'startport,endport'. If not set, this will default to 50000,51000
;        
IncomingPortRange = 50000, 51000
;
;        Port range to use for outgoing connections.  The format is
;        'startport,endport'.  Only use this if your firewall restricts outgoing
;        ports and gridftp won't work otherwise. The default is not restrict
;        outgoing TCP ports.
;        
; OutgoingPortRange =
;
;        Hostname or IP address of the interface to use for data connections.
;        If not set in this file, then the default behavior is:
;        - When run on an EC2 instance, the data interface will be
;          automatically configured to use the public ipv4 address of the
;          instance.
;        - When run on a non-EC2 instance, if ServerHost is set, then that
;          value is used. If this resolves to a private
;          IP address, a warning will be issued.
;        - Otherwise, this will not be set, and the gridftp server will tell
;          clients to connect to the IP address that the control connection
;          was established on.

;        Restricted path configuration.

;        A comma separated list of full paths that clients may access.
;        Each path may be prefixed by R and/or W, denoting read or write
;        access, or N to explicitly deny access to a path.  If a given path
;        is a directory, all contents and subdirectories will be given the
;        same access.  Order of paths does not matter---the permissions
;        on the longest matching path will apply.  The special character
;        '~' will be replaced by the authenticated user's home directory,
;        and * may be used for simple wildcard matching.  By default all
;        paths are allowed, and access control is handled by the OS
;
;        Examples:
;
;        Allow read access to /data and full access to the user's home
;        directory:
;        ----
;            RestrictPaths = RW~,R/data
;        ----

;        Allow full access to the home directory, but deny hidden files there:

;        ----

;        If not specified, this will default to False.

;        In order to use sharing, the endpoint will need to be a managed
;        endpoint associated with a Globus subscription uuid. Additional

[GCS Manager]

;        The service name of the GCS Management server. If not set,
;        then no GCS Management service will be configured.
;
;        If the value is set. Then the service will be configured on the
;        local machine if one of the following conditions are met:
;
;        - The value of ServerName matches the current machine's public
;          hostname.
;        - The value of ServerName does not match the current machine's public
;          hostname, but the ServerHost matches the current machine's
;          hostname.
;
;        The special value %(HOSTNAME)s will substitute the machine's public
;        hostname. By default, this is unset.
;

;
;        The name of the machine hosting the GCS Manager Service. This
